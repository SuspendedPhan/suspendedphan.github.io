## CoreDash
The safety operator's (passenger seat) user interface to the vehicle
AI on daily autonomous test drives. I helped completely rewrite this software.

### What was my impact?
I coded the mission UI. Without my work, the vehicle could not move.

### Why was it difficult?
- Some features could only be tested on-vehicle. It took live debugging over chat
to get leads on any bugs.
- Missions required a single point of coordination with 3 other teams.
- Required judgement calls on how to handle edge cases beyond the UI mockup.
- Unique, heterogeneous IPC stack required troubleshooting messaging problems
and caused build problems on individual dev machines.
- Complex async state with clunky APIs.

## Fleet Pairing Dashboard
A web UI to help manage vehicle configuration.

### What was my impact?
The UI prevented demo failures and enabled users outside the dev team: demo operators, QA, other devs.

### Why was it difficult?
- I created this dashboard from scratch by myself.
- This was an urgent request, and I had to learn Vue.
- No support from UX designers.

Software Engineer<br>
Keywords: AR/VR, 3D, Unity, iOS, Android, C++, Shaders, Education

## Google Expeditions
Teachers can use Google Cardboard to lead students on a VR field trip or use AR to teach objects.<br>
We launched the 2.0 version, which introduced AR.

### What was my impact?
I coded the 3D and 2D UI for AR manipulation.
I helped us meet the quality bar for launch.

### Why was it difficult?
- Codebase spanned iOS, Android and C++. Getting any new UI input to the renderer required
modifying layers and layers.
- I fixed a time-dependent networking bug inherited from authors long gone.

## Toontastic
Kids can create cartoons by controlling puppets and improving a story.

### What was my impact?
I coded the scene arrangement and music selection UIs.<br>
I made character control really juicy.<br>
I helped us meet the quality bar for launch.

### Why was it difficult?
The procedurally generated curve for the story arc required my own design instincts beyond
the single frame mockup.

## Tilt Brush (VR art tool) - 20% project
### What was my impact?
I made paintbrushes that were wackier than any existing brush. Procedurally generated.

### Why was it difficult?
- I decided what the brushes would look like.
- Shader code is hard to debug.

## Waymo (autonomous vehicles)
I was on the motion planning team.

### What was my impact?
I improved our collision mitigation and collected metrics to show evidence.<br>
I reduced the number of pedestrian collisions in simulation.

### Why was it difficult?
I hypothesized algorithms, tested them in simulation, then threw them away and tried again.

## Android's Builtin Alarm Clock App
### What was my impact?
I made improvements to the UI.

# Google

## Internal Web Framework
Like React, but for different needs.

### What was my impact?
I made the framework compatible with Web Components.<br>
I made Material Design components for the framework's library.
